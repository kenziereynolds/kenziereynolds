# About me


**kenziereynolds/kenziereynolds** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a masters degree in Health Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate through github and utilise data in research.
- 💬 Ask me about my work on rabies (I may get excited)...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I got denied entry to Sweden at border control, whilst going to study!
